# PACKMAN — Quick start

Installer file to published Intune app, in the shortest path that works. Every step links to the
full explanation in **[README.md](README.md)**.

> **Before you start:** Windows, the .NET 10 Desktop Runtime, a PSADT v4 template folder
> **including the runtime**, `IntuneWinAppUtil.exe`, and an Intune account with the required Graph
> permissions — see [Requirements](README.md#requirements).

---

## 1. Set it up once

Open **Settings** and complete two sections, then press **Save settings**:

1. **Authentication** — press **Sign in** (interactive needs no app registration), then
   **Test connection** to check Graph read access. Review the documented permissions for publishing and group changes.
2. **Network Paths** — **Intune Applications Path** (where packages are written), **PSADT Template
   Path**, and **IntuneWinAppUtil Path**.

Code signing, group-assignment defaults, Intune defaults and the theme are optional.
→ [First-run setup](README.md#first-run-setup--the-settings-page)

## 2. Generate the package

**Create Package** → drag your **MSI or EXE** onto the Source installer field. Name, manufacturer,
version and icon are filled from the installer; correct anything you disagree with, pick
**x64/x86** and **SYSTEM/USER**, then **Generate package**.

→ [Creating a package](README.md#creating-a-package) — including exactly what an MSI fills in
versus an EXE, and where the package lands on disk.

## 3. Fix the script (EXE packages only)

An MSI package usually runs as generated. An **EXE** package is written with `<silent flags>` and
`<uninstall flags>` placeholders — open **Edit script** and replace them with the installer's real
switches, then Ctrl+S.

→ [Editing the deploy script](README.md#editing-the-deploy-script)

## 4. Test it on a real machine (recommended)

**Remote Test** → enter a computer name, then **Ping**. Choose **System** or **User** to match the
app’s Intune install behavior, then **Run install**. Check the discovered detection rule and use
**Use for publishing** to carry it into Configure for the wizard’s package. Verify **Run uninstall**
on the test device too; test devices need WinRM and admin-share access.

→ [Remote testing](README.md#remote-testing)

## 5. Publish

**Continue to configure**, then:

1. Check the **Name in Intune**.
2. Confirm the **detection method** — MSI packages default to the product code; anything else needs
   a path.
3. Use **Silent** for unattended Intune deployment and verify that both commands need no user input.
4. Add **assignment** groups, each with its own intent (Required / Available / Uninstall).
5. **Review deployment**, check the summary, **Build & publish**.
