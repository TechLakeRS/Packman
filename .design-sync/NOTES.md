# design-sync notes - Packman

Repo-specific facts for the next sync. Read before running anything.

## What this design system is

- Packman is a **WPF / .NET 10 desktop app** (C#, XAML, WPF-UI Fluent controls). It has no
  React or JavaScript component library, so this is a **tokens-only** sync (user's explicit
  choice, 2026-09-02): colours for both themes, typography, per-control recipe tokens, the
  bundled fonts and the icon geometries. Zero components by design - do not try to
  reimplement the XAML controls as React lookalikes.
- The source of truth is `Packman/Themes/DarkTheme.xaml`, `LightTheme.xaml`, `Styles.xaml`,
  `Icons.xaml` and `Packman/Fonts/*.ttf`. `.design-sync/gen-tokens.mjs` converts them
  deterministically into the synthetic package `.design-sync/pkg/` (`packman-tokens`):
  `tokens/{colors,typography,components}.css`, `fonts.css`, `styles.css`, `docs/icons.md`.
  `cfg.buildCmd` runs that script; re-run it whenever the XAML or fonts change and commit the
  regenerated files (they are committed so the package is reviewable and self-contained).

## How the converter is wired

- `.ds-sync/` is staged from the skill and gets `packman-tokens` as a **file: dependency**
  so `node_modules/packman-tokens` is a symlink to `.design-sync/pkg`:
  `cd .ds-sync && npm i esbuild ts-morph @types/react react react-dom playwright@1.56.1 ../.design-sync/pkg`
  Run the converter with `--node-modules .ds-sync/node_modules` (no `--entry` needed).
- `playwright@1.56.1` matches the pre-installed browsers under `/opt/pw-browsers` in the
  claude.ai/code container (`PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` is set there). Elsewhere run
  `npx playwright install chromium` once. The render check has nothing to render (0 previews)
  but validate still requires playwright to be importable.
- Token naming: XAML key minus the `Color`/`Brush` suffix, kebab-cased, `--pm-` prefix
  (`Card2Color` -> `--pm-card-2`). Control recipes are `--pm-<style-key>-<prop>`
  (`PrimaryButton.Padding` -> `--pm-primary-button-padding`). WPF thickness order `l,t,r,b`
  is converted to CSS `t r b l`; `h,v` to `v h`.
- Dark is `:root` (the app starts in Dark, App.xaml). Light is `[data-theme="light"]`. The
  app's "System" option is not mirrored with a media query on purpose - designs should be
  explicit about the theme they show.

## Known validate output

- `[FONT_MISSING] "Cascadia Mono"` - expected. The XAML font stacks put the Windows system
  faces first (Segoe UI Variable, Cascadia Mono, Consolas) and the bundled OFL faces last;
  the bundled Instrument Sans / JetBrains Mono / Martian Mono are what renders everywhere
  else. Accepted as a substitute by design (user chose tokens-only from the repo's own fonts).
- The generated README body says "React library" and "All 0 components" - the prepended
  `conventions.md` corrects that in its first lines; the body text is the converter's template.

## Upload status

- 2026-09-02: first run in claude.ai/code. `DesignSync` was **not authorized** in that remote
  session (the tool asks for `/design-login` from an interactive Claude Code session on the
  same machine, or Claude Design's "Send to Claude Code Web"). The bundle was built and
  validated locally (`ds-bundle/`, validate exit 0) but **nothing was uploaded** and no project
  exists yet - `config.json` has no `projectId`. The next authorized run is a first-time import:
  create a fresh project, pin its id, upload via the incremental path.

## Re-sync risks

- Generated CSS in `.design-sync/pkg/` goes stale silently if `Packman/Themes/*.xaml` changes
  and nobody re-runs `gen-tokens.mjs`. When in doubt, run it - a no-op diff is the check.
- `gen-tokens.mjs` reads template `CornerRadius` from the control's chrome `Border` (named
  `bd`, else the one bound to the template Background/BorderBrush). A restyled template that
  renames that Border can pick the wrong radius - eyeball `tokens/components.css` after a
  Styles.xaml change.
- Font faces are matched from file names `<Family>-<Weight>.ttf`; a new family or weight
  makes the generator throw until its `FAMILY` / `FILE_WEIGHT` maps are extended.
- WPF-UI's own Fluent control templates (`ui:ThemesDictionary`, `ui:ControlsDictionary`) are
  not represented - only Packman's overriding dictionaries are. Controls the app takes
  straight from WPF-UI (dialogs, scrollbars, toggles) have no recipe here.
- Toolchain: node 22, esbuild/ts-morph latest at staging time; nothing is fetched from the
  network during the build itself.
